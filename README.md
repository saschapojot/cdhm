1. Eigenvalue problem 
(a). To compute eigenvalue problem for 1 ratio a/b, run cns.py
(b). To scan different ratios a/b, run runTwoPairCNS.py, where twoPairCNS.py is imported.

2. To compute pumping, run cnsPumping.py

3. To plot pumping results for 3 bands, run plt3Pumpings.py

4. To plot pumping results for 3 bands with omegaF=0, run plt3PumpingsOmegaF0.py
